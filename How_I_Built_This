# HOW I BUILT THIS — Log & Prompts

This file documents how the site was created so you can explain it to your teacher.

Summary
- Repo type: User site or project site on GitHub Pages.
- Files to add: `index.md` (this file), `HOW_I_BUILT_THIS.md`, and `assets/avatar.png` (optional but recommended).
- Hosting: Create a repo named YOUR_HANDLE.github.io (replace YOUR_HANDLE) and push these files to the `main` branch, or put them in `/docs` and enable Pages.

Commands I ran (replace YOUR_HANDLE):
```
git init
git add index.md HOW_I_BUILT_THIS.md assets/avatar.png
git commit -m "Initial fun portfolio"
# create repo on GitHub named YOUR_HANDLE.github.io via web UI
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_HANDLE/YOUR_HANDLE.github.io.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Files added
- `index.md` — the single-file landing page (contains embedded HTML and CSS for a fun design).
- `HOW_I_BUILT_THIS.md` — this explanation file.
- `assets/avatar.png` — put an avatar or image in this path (create `assets/` folder).

AI use & prompts
- I used an AI assistant to create the initial playful design and structure. I then edited and personalized the content and links myself.
- Example prompts I used (paste the actual prompts you used when you present):
  - Prompt A: "Generate a playful GitHub Pages index.md for a student portfolio. Include a colorful hero, floating shapes, project cards, contact links, and a short 'How I built this' section. Use embedded CSS so it can be published with a single file."
  - Prompt B (follow-up): "Make the design friendly and modern, add hover effects for projects, and include a small responsive layout for mobile."

What I edited manually
- Replaced placeholders (YOUR_NAME, YOUR_HANDLE).
- Added my real project links and descriptions.
- Added my avatar image to `assets/avatar.png`.
- Checked rendering on mobile and adjusted text.

How to explain this to the teacher (2–3 sentences)
- "I used an AI assistant to generate a single-file Markdown landing page with embedded HTML/CSS. I customized the output by replacing placeholders with my name, adding real project links and an avatar, and then published it to GitHub Pages at https://YOUR_HANDLE.github.io. The HOW_I_BUILT_THIS.md contains the exact prompts and commands I executed."

Notes & optional improvements
- If you want a themed URL (project page path), use the `/docs` folder instead of a user site repo.
- To add more polish: separate CSS into `assets/styles.css`, add a favicon, or use a Jekyll theme.
- Keep a copy of the original AI prompts in this file (teachers may ask to inspect them).

Deadline reminder
- Publish and post your link in the monthly challenge thread before Jan 4, 2026 10:00 PM.

Good luck — personalize the text and show the prompts + the edits. If you paste your filled-in index.md here, I’ll review it and suggest small improvements for clarity and presentation.
